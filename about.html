        <p id="aboutMe"> My name is Jasmine, and I am a parent, veteran, and student with a passion for using technology to create inclusive solutions. My journey is shaped by lived experience—raising children with unique needs while navigating school, business, and community challenges. These experiences inspired me to launch EZ Tech Cyberlab, a nonprofit community hub that blends innovation, education, and accessibility.</p>

    <h1 id="ISee">Vision</h1>
        <p id="vision">
        Our vision is to build a future where communities can invent, protect, and scale their own solutions—whether through coding, hardware design, or sensory innovation. We believe technology should not only connect us but also provide safety, comfort, and opportunity for all, especially those with special needs.
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I’ve worked on and the skills I bring to the table. I’m excited to connect and collaborate on innovative solutions!</p>
