  <h2>The Interactive Sensory Plant</h2>
 <p>The Interactive Sensory Plant was developed to address a pressing concern for many parents and caregivers of children with special needs â€” ensuring both safety and emotional well-being. While current technologies such as AirTags and AngelSense watches provide location tracking, they do not offer emotional or sensory support that can comfort and regulate a child in real time. <br>
</p>
</div>
<p>
This project introduces a compassionate alternative: a synthetic sensory plant system that integrates technology, design, and inclusivity. The plant reacts to environmental changes and interactions, offering both security alerts and sensory engagement in one natural, calming form.
 </p>
 <div>
 <h2>Problem</h2>
 <p>Parents of children with special needs often struggle with not knowing how their child feels or how safe they are when apart. Traditional devices focus on tracking or monitoring, but they lack the emotional and sensory support necessary to comfort children who may experience anxiety, overstimulation, or distress.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The Interactive Plant Guardian merges sensory feedback with intelligent environmental awareness. By combining motion, touch, and air-quality sensors, the system provides real-time alerts and interactive responses designed to soothe and engage the child while ensuring safety in various environments such as classrooms, homes, or daycare centers.</p>
