  <h2>The Innovation Claim</h2>
 <p>The Interactive Sensory Plant merges emotional regulation with environmental intelligence, creating dual-purpose assistive technology that enhances well-being and safety through a multi-sensory experience. <br>
</p>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
The Interactive Sensory Plant is a smart, responsive system designed to support children with special needs by combining safety awareness with sensory comfort. It functions as both a decorative and interactive element, helping children self-regulate emotions while alerting caregivers to environmental changes.
This prototype uses a network of sensors integrated within a synthetic plant to detect motion, touch, and air qualityâ€”responding through lights, sounds, and gentle feedback that promote calmness and safety.
</p>

<p>
This project introduces a compassionate alternative: a synthetic sensory plant system that integrates technology, design, and inclusivity. The plant reacts to environmental changes and interactions, offering both security alerts and sensory engagement in one natural, calming form.
 </p>
 <div>
 <h2>Problem</h2>
 <p>Parents of children with special needs often struggle with not knowing how their child feels or how safe they are when apart. Traditional devices focus on tracking or monitoring, but they lack the emotional and sensory support necessary to comfort children who may experience anxiety, overstimulation, or distress.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The Interactive Plant Guardian merges sensory feedback with intelligent environmental awareness. By combining motion, touch, and air-quality sensors, the system provides real-time alerts and interactive responses designed to soothe and engage the child while ensuring safety in various environments such as classrooms, homes, or daycare centers.</p>
